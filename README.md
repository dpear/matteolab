# Getting Started

Initially you should have a user account on the Frazer Lab server. In order to access the server from your home terminal:
```
ssh username@flh1.ucsd.edu
```

You should typically not work on the head node. After you have logged in, to navigate elsewhere:
```
ssh n1
```


First you will need to install miniconda locally. If this is something you've never done before or have limited experience with (and are working with CAST), it might be useful to ask someone for more help with this issue. Otherwise proceed as follows.
